# CMU-Machine-learning-10-601
It is related to course on Machine learning conducted by Tom Mitchell in Carnegie Mellon University.

It has all the solution to coding homeworks of above course.

Most of the codes are written in MATLAB an can be converted to OCTAVE by doing simple modification.

All codes are written by me.

Feel free to use it as a reference for your work.
